## Hey, I'm Warren ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently building the next-generation of API development tools at [@Eject](https://github.com/eject-tech), where I lead engineering and commercial partnerships.

Eject is the culmination of years of experience shipping tech products and running lean engineering teams that can focus on solutions that matter. Vastly reducing overall effort, margin for error, and time to market. Eject brings these principles and value to a low-code platform where anyone can deliver API solutions more effectively, faster, and with less resource.
